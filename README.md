Solid Conway is a set of scripts for creating solid representations of evolutions in Conway's game of life.

The script comes in two flavors:

- golly script/openscad.py is a script that can be run from within Golly to generate an openSCAD program for the evolution of the current pattern.
- solid_conway.py is a command-line tool for building an object represented by a series of RLE files generated by Golly or another program.
